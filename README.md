### Game Instructions 

This was a lot of fun to work on. In this, the third project of Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program, I was provided with a game loop engine, and visual assets, with the task to create a video game based off the 1981 iconic video game "Frogger". I used HTML5 Canvas, CSS and JavaScript to build this project. I incorporated custom images, and features, to make the game more unique and express my creativity; creating a more pleasant user experience. 

The instructions on how to play are listed below. [**Click Here**](http://samurairanderson.github.io/P3-Classic-Arcade-Game-Clone) if you have a couple of minutes and give it a go!! Good luck & thanks for playing!!

* Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left and right. 

* Colliding with a bug results in the loss of one of your lives.

* Your player/Kitten gets NINE lives!

* Collect 50 points by crossing the stone tiles & making it to the water without running into a bug.
